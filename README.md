# CoulexAngCorr
Imposes angular correlation of the projectile scattering angle and gamma-ray emission direction following Coulomb excitation

Durign Coulomb excitation, the projectile nucleus scattering angle and the emission direction of the subsequent gamma-ray are correlated and the gamma-ray emission direction is not isotropic. Further, this correlation is affected by the CM energy of the reaction, which varies as the projectile propagates through a thick reaction target. This code modifies Geant4-simulated spectra to include the effects of angular correlation using the Geant track weighting mechanism.
